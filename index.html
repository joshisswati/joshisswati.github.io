            <h3>PhD Student in Economics, University of Wisconsin-Madison</h3>
            <p>Welcome! I am currently a second-year PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, studying Public and IO. Previously, I was a research analyst at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. I am broadly interested in how government policy can exacerbate inequality across several dimensions, including race and income.</p>
