	<p>I am a second year PhD student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, studying Public and IO. Previously, I was a research analyst at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. I am broadly interested in how government policy can exacerbate inequality across several dimensions, including race and income. </p>
